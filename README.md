## Election-Audit Summary

The code that I developed for the Election Audit is easily transferable between local elections. All I would require is a .csv data file with the same information presented. This would allow me to investigate other successful county candidates and total number of votes cast in each county. I also determined that the script that I designed could effortlessly be modified to include the total eligible voting population of each county. This would allow us to further examine the success of each county's voter turnout and give us more detail as to where to increase efforts in an attempt to raise the number of total ballots cast.
